In this presentation titled "Building Table Top Roleplay Games with F#" Jack Danna, also known as Javk Wick, shares his journey of creating Fogent Roleplay, a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG), and the transition from using traditional JS based tools to adopting F# for development. Drawing parallels between coding and TTRPG creation, Jack outlines the limitations he faced with existing systems like Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) and the inspiration he found in Cogent Roleplay. However, recognizing the shortcomings of Cogent Roleplay, Jack embarked on developing his own ruleset under the name "Fallen," which eventually evolved into Fogent Roleplay. He details the challenges encountered during the development process, including the need for a more robust language with better typing capabilities, leading him to F# and the Fable compiler. Jack emphasizes the benefits of functional programming in both code development and game design, highlighting how "Thinking Functionally" transformed his approach to problem-solving. Through his experience, he encourages others to pursue passion projects, underscoring the profound impact they can have on one's enthusiasm for programming.
